1. AI : human intelligence in machines. It can be a program or a whole insane machine. The key apsect is 

2. ML : Set of algorithms which are based on statistical and mathematical(like probability, distributions curves, gaussain squre methods) formulae and fundamentals->preparing model using such algo for automating decision capability gives us self learning, intelligence proprty to machines, a kind of mimicry, which we humans have

3. DL : acheiving self learning, self decision making kind of intelligence in machines(hardware or software) using a particular set of ML algorithms with network theory approach, forming network of computing nodes i.e special mathematical functions called artifical neurons implemented either in hardware or software(using principles of threads)

4. DATASCIENCE(Modern STATISTICIANS)




Understanding functions and its significance with prediction, real time consequneces and meaning

Eg:
5kg sugar = Rs.55


10kg ???


f(x)=C*x

Pandas:- To manipulate Datasheets/Databases
	1. Null values delete 
	2. NA values fill up using statistical operations: - Mean, Median, Mode
	3. Correlation (-1 to 1) 
	4. 

a=x,b,c,d,e,f=columns	 f(x)
| correlation
-1 to 1


-1->invesrely co-related
0->there is no co-related
1->perfectly co-related


if a=2=x->f(x)

b=5
b=a*2+1=g(a)
c=h(a)

(x+a)^2=x*x + 2*a*x + a*a
(x+a)^3=
(a+b+c+d)^2=



f(x)= -----Consist of terms that contain x which are hard to tabulate manually--------------------------------------



NUmpy- mathematical calculations
Pandas- Data manipulations/ exploration/transformation 
Scilearn- Consist of classes and functions which have algorithms that generate statistical models which are deployed for developers to embed in applications or host on servers.


How to solve Ml problems???

1. Decide type of problem solution: A. Supervised B. Unsupervised C. Reinforcement
2. Data aqcuisation
3. Data explore
4. Data preparation -   a. data validation and clean
			b. missing values
			c. data imbalancement
			d. transformation
5. model development 	a. feature engineering
		  	b. models and algos try
		  	c. model score
		  	d. select the model
6. Model maintain
7. Deployment
